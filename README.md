DigitalPedalBoard
=================

Build your own pedal board and create cool and unique effects to play your guitar or your bass (or other).



##What do I need to know ?

If you just wanna play some musics and don't want to create your own effects or personalize your program you can just follow the installing steps and get started !

But if you want to create your own effects and make your physical pedalboard, you'll need to learn (if you don't know it already):

 - Python 2.7* programming language (take a look at the [Python 2 Official Tutorial] (http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ "Python 2 Official Tutorial")
 - Basic knowledge in DSP (Digital Signal Processing), you only have to understand how to make things work and to understand some basic filters.
 - If you want to build a physical pedalboard, you'll need some knowledge in eletrical circuits (no big deal, you won't need to know Laplace Transformation and advanced topics). If want to build everything by yourself, you may need to know how to program an ARM (we recommend [http://arduino.cc/ "Arduino"]), but you can choose any ARM you want.
